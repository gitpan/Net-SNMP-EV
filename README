NAME
    Net::SNMP::EV - adaptor to integrate Net::SNMP into the EV event loop.

SYNOPSIS
     use EV;
     use Net::SNMP;
     use Net::SNMP::EV;

     # just use Net::SNMP and EV as you like:

     ... start non-blocking snmp request(s)...

     EV::loop;

DESCRIPTION
    This module coerces the Net::SNMP scheduler to use the EV high
    performance event loop as underlying event loop, i.e. EV will be used by
    Net::SNMP for all events.

    This integrates Net::SNMP into EV: You can make non-blocking Net::SNMP
    calls and as long as your main program uses the EV event loop, they will
    run in parallel to anything else that uses EV or AnyEvent.

    This module does not export anything and does not require you to do
    anything special apart from loading it.

    The module is quite short, you can use it as example to implement a
    similar integration into e.g. Event or other event loops.

BUGS
    Net::SNMP has no (documented or otherwise) API to do what this module
    does. As such, this module rummages around in the internals of Net::SNMP
    in a rather inacceptable way, and as thus might be very sensitive to the
    version of Net::SNMP used (it has been tested with some 5.x versions
    only, YMMV).

SEE ALSO
    EV, Net::SNMP, AnyEvent, Glib::EV.
